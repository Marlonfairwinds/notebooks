Hi Nate

 

We can give you access to both of your cost management. Can you please confirm the emails you want access to? I know you have two. Maybe Ed also has another one.

Edwin,

 

I don’t have access in Azure to see our costs per server and such.  Can that be granted to me as well as Ed Turner?

 

Thanks,

Security or policy violation

How to Fix It
The recipient's email server won't accept your message because it appears to violate their security or policy settings. Check the Reported error below to see if you can determine why it was blocked. Then try one or more of the following:
·        If the error mentions SPF, DKIM, or DMARC issues, forward this message to your email admin for assistance.
·        The recipient's email server might suspect that your message is spam. Follow the guidance in this article: E-mailing Best Practices for Senders<https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=526654>. Then resend your message.
·        If the error suggests your message is too large, try to reduce the size of your attachment. If that isn't possible, place the file on a publicly accessible cloud storage location, like OneDrive. Then add a link to the file in your message, and resend the message.
·        Contact the recipient (by phone, for example) and tell them to ask their email admin to add you or your email domain to their allowed senders list.
If the problem continues, forward this message to your email admin. If you're an email admin, refer to the More Info for Email Admins section below.

More Info for Email Admins
Status code: 550 5.7.1

This error occurs when the recipient's domain has security or policy settings that reject the sender's message. However, we were unable to determine the specific setting that's causing this rejection. Usually the error is reported by an email server outside of Office 365. Common issues include the following: the receiving server suspects the message is malicious or spam; the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record for mota-design.com is incorrectly configured or doesn't exist; or the message includes an attachment larger than the receiving server will accept. Try one or more of the following:

Review the reported error - Check the Reported error shown below to help determine what the issue might be. For example, if the issue is related to an SPF failure, the reported error will usually include the acronym ""SPF"" or the phrase ""Sender Policy Framework.""

Correctly configure your SPF records - If you're the sender's email admin, make sure your domain's SPF records at your domain registrar are properly configured. Office 365 supports only one SPF record (a TXT record that defines SPF) for your domain. Include the following domain name: spf.protection.outlook.com. If you have a hybrid configuration (some mailboxes in the cloud and some mailboxes on premises) or if you're an Exchange Online Protection standalone customer, add the outbound IP address of your on-premises servers to the TXT record. To learn how, see Customize an SPF record to validate outbound email sent from your domain<https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn789058(v=exchg.150).aspx> and External Domain Name System records for Office 365<https://support.office.com/article/External-Domain-Name-System-records-for-Office-365-c0531a6f-9e25-4f2d-ad0e-a70bfef09ac0#BKMK_SPFrecords>.

Unable to relay - If the Reported error indicates a problem with relaying (e.g. ""unable to relay""), then the email server that reported the error likely isn't set up correctly to receive and relay messages from the sender's domain. This server will usually be one of your on-premises servers in a hybrid environment, a smart host email service that you're trying to route messages through, or possibly even an email hosting service you used in the past yet still have mail flow settings pointing to (e.g. your MX record at your domain registrar still points to your previous email service provider). Check Error reported by shown below to determine what domain, service, or server is reporting the error. The email server needs to be configured to either accept messages from anonymous users or to include the sending domain or IP in its list of authenticated senders. On an Exchange server, you can set this up in the server's receive connector. If it's a smart host managed by another service or partner, contact the service or partner to configure their servers to accept and relay messages from your senders. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure your MX records are properly configured.

Contact the recipient's email admin - For some scenarios, you can fix the issue by contacting the email admin at the recipient domain to ask them to add the sender's email address or your domain to their allowed senders list, or to relax the setting that's causing the rejection.

Hi Vivian,
What are some of the client email addresses you've been having trouble getting emails from?

Vivian Esparza - Site Performance Manager ( 3/29/2023 - 8:04 )

Good morning, Im having issues with my email. I sometimes don't receive email from people at my client site. I reached out to the IT tech here at the site and this is what she said

""Tell your IT that Paulson IT has added your email and domain to our safelist but your still getting errors.""

Contact the recipient's email admin - For some scenarios, you can fix the issue by contacting the email admin at the recipient domain to ask them to add the sender's email address or your domain to their allowed senders list, or to relax the setting that's causing the rejection.

Subject: Re: Unmatched Logo

Thanks all.  Just heading off some heat from the NFL marketing outside of the Dolphins and Saints home marketing territories.  These brands have the NFL in our brand so this change is just on the site.

 

With that said, we may want to consider phasing the integrated NFL logos out of this brand the next release.  

 

This probably wouldn't be the case for a commercial premium offering in distribution because those wines would be sold only in each team's HMA.

Apparently Microsoft Teams does not support this configuration 100%, and I would like to confirm that with you.

 

His experience is that when he joins or hosts a teams meeting and tries to share his HDR screen to that meeting, the meeting will crash after a few seconds/minutes. Teams will not crash, just the meeting itself crashes and goes away completely – Microsoft Teams is still up in the background and he can continue to chat/type in Teams, but he cannot rejoin the meeting itself without starting a new meeting.

 

Is this expected behavior, and is there a fixed planned?

Could you help me out reviewing if we can change our Teams meetings policy to have “allow sharing screen” to everyone as our default?

 

We’re stumbling on our clients’ meetings when we must manually give access every time they want to share screen. This causes delays on the conversation and make us look unprepared or not giving attention to details when clients try to do so.

Subject: Ruby Points - new rebranding ASA

 

Hello team,

 

ASA is having a new rebranding for this they want us to make some slight modifications to the logo + website.

 

In terms of logo - @Lisa Struck they requested the following:

 

1. They want us to replace the current badge mark in their logo with the one attached and set it over to them for approval before making it live.
2. Find here folder with all new rebranding specs and assets Alyssa sent us: New rebranding ASA (https://fairwindssw.sharepoint.com/sites/rubypoints/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=77nXSg3giWOEhm%2FWBKg1ANmVJG4sB883N5lZPTZKBjg%3D&folderid=2_1e159334c33de4e7fa71c538f8784dd2b&rev=1&e=6fEPun)

 

In terms of website @Ricardo Parraga @Natalie Hey-Shipton:

 

1. They requested if we could change all parts where we have the gold color (see attached) on the website to the CODE COLOR BADGE GOLD HEX #E5B64B.
2. I will keep you posted on any further website edits they could have.

 

 

1. For marketing purposes, emails, social media they would also want us to take into consideration their new rebranding assets here New rebranding ASA (https://fairwindssw.sharepoint.com/sites/rubypoints/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=77nXSg3giWOEhm%2FWBKg1ANmVJG4sB883N5lZPTZKBjg%3D&folderid=2_1e159334c33de4e7fa71c538f8784dd2b&rev=1&e=6fEPun) @Natalie Hey-Shipton @Alba  Melendez.

 

1. They are doing these changes towards the end of May, so we will make all these changes live until that date (probably around May 24th – 25th, she will confirm with us on that).

I have a request to re-route all missed calls from the Customer Service Inbound Line to my number: 707-353-5951 in order to follow up with our customers.

 

Those calls were assigned to Gonzalo’s number, and he is no longer part of the company.

 

Thanks in advance for your help.

30215,411375451273,411375451273,2023-05-18T20:21:06Z,Problem Granting Guest Access to SharePoint,"Good afternoon,

 

I am trying to grant an external user access to a SharePoint site, the OASIS Plus Portal (https://geminiind.sharepoint.com/sites/OASISPlushttps:/geminiind.sharepoint.com/sites/OASISPlus) ,  and am having problems. Here’s what I’ve done so far.

 

I confirmed that the SharePoint site allows sharing with existing guests.

 

 

I issued a Guest user invitation, which the user has accepted.

 

 

 

I created a group, OASIS Plus Portal Consultants, to manage the user’s access, assigned the group Restricted View permissions, and added the user to the group.

 

 

I confirmed that the user successfully signed in.

 

 

 

I accepted the access request issued by SharePoint.

 

 

When the user attempts to access the SharePoint site, he receives a message that he does not have access.

 

Can you help me figure out what I’m doing wrong (or not doing)?

 

Thanks,

Vince

Dear D4,

 We're pleased to announce a new VMware Skyline Advisor Pro release with support for SaaS subscriptions, including vSphere+ support, and new proactive Findings. If you have Auto Upgrade enabled, your Skyline Collector will automatically update. 

A summary of the new features is below.

 New Feature Highlights:

 SaaS Subscription Support Customers with VMware SaaS subscriptions, including vSphere+ can now use Skyline Advisor Pro. Currently, the VMware Production Support level is assigned to all active SaaS subscriptions. 
When both an Entitlement Account and a SaaS Subscription are present, Skyline access is based on the highest Entitlement Account level. 
To access Skyline, at least one Entitlement Account or SaaS subscription needs to be active or linked. 
A grace period of 60 days is activated after the last Entitlement Account or SaaS subscription expires. During this time, you can assign an active Entitlement Account or new SaaS subscription to continue Skyline operations. Otherwise, the service will enter a deactivated state. 
 

View information about your current EA and SaaS subscriptions on the Advisor Pro Dashboard.

 Skyline Collector Tip: Note that if your Collectors are running v3.1, you must manually upgrade them, due to an issue in how the proxy configuration is propagated from the Skyline UI through the backend service to the OS level. This has been resolved in subsequent Collector versions, and the Auto Upgrade function works as intended. Please refer to https://u12668197.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=6iGNSpqHRcwtiIAH-2FSt-2FcKySMdwaBnEuRuzONUr7IsrHMmrQcvQbhpnTRxWGQ5ckU6g4_-2BHB8d5C343hfLp7ljYtulT4AqbeLZ38PYBdqNT1vgjI0Zi3B3Anxpq0bQnMfJhjd8EGrHw7-2Bx3WfXKonnz0xMtM-2F4LqQKNCN0CgYnI20aS1r6BdjvZn7SnU-2FAn8gujguoWxTkUoNNoRoyVp7dX9y9jRSk64ZGLZP8lUsPHvwXGYlsIwr0Gtd-2B355qFcOU2hyJazWEhMTCE-2BJcIR0rJs4eqVzKc2iooPv5vg0vWozWJxQHES7vYHoan1fUdzppvvHnw3EFkVSIIV0wR-2BF7GvM79p-2F3U8SxmrM9v0su2WI2ZuquLJzPLanaXUpM9SfEPcAEz8fLegRW0emARmQUHaZOKPL3NLx7gxMMnMUc4JCQXT-2FXcqrkjFnU8QcxTGrJdmi . We strongly recommend running the latest Skyline Collector version v3.4 to take advantage of all Skyline features.

Hello,

Your certificate (or certificates) for the names listed below will expire in 7 days (on 2023-05-24). Please make sure to renew your certificate before then, or visitors to your web site will encounter errors.

We recommend renewing certificates automatically when they have a third of their total lifetime left. For Let's Encrypt's current 90-day certificates, that means renewing 30 days before expiration. See https://letsencrypt.org/docs/integration-guide/ for details.

For details about when we send these emails, please visit: https://letsencrypt.org/docs/expiration-emails/ In particular, note that this reminder email is still sent if you've obtained a slightly different certificate by adding or removing names. If you've replaced this certificate with a newer one that covers more or fewer names than the list above, you may be able to ignore this message.

Hola Daisy

En este caso deben validar con su servidor de correos el inconveniente, ya que Softland si envía los correos.

Puedes hablar con TI y que prueben enviar los correos de otra cuenta para validar si el inconveniente se genera con la cuenta actual.

This is a business impacting issue currently experienced by several people at the office this morning.

If their computer has been remote or the user has not been online for several days, the Microsoft credential verification is not redirecting properly to the OKTA authentication window.

For users experiencing this issue, it has been associated with their Outlook session.  For the same users, I am unable to authenticate them to a web portal session via portal.office.com again with the issue being OKTA is not opening for account verification.

This is a fairly significant issue that is impacting several of our users this morning.

Who can assist with reviewing this issue and when should I expect an agent to review this issue?

Thank you,

SummaryUpgrade ESXI to V7.03

ResolutionKindly follow the below steps for upgrading the same.For the ESXI Host 1 . Check whether the server that you are using is compatible or not.2. Download the version that you want to upgrade to from the Customer Connect Poral  .3. Take the Backup if the host using this KB .4. Place the host into the maintenance mode .5 . Follow the Steps for upgrading the same from here  .6.For upgrading the same using CLI , follow the below steps   1. Run this command and make sure that the bootbank should not point to tmp folder:   ls -ltrh    2. Upload the .zip file to the datastore.    3.Put the host in maintenance mode and take backup of the host configuration using :    vim-cmd hostsvc/firmware/sync_config    vim-cmd hostsvc/firmware/backup_config Note: The command should output a URL in which a web browser may be used to download the file. For example :Bundle can be downloaded at : http://*/downloads/123456/configBundle-xx.xx.xx.xx.tgzWhere * denotes the host IP/FQDN.The backup file is also located in the /scratch/downloads directory as configBundle-HostFQDN.tgz    4.Browse to that datastore location using the following command:    cd /vmfs/volumes/datastore_name/folder_name/file.zip    5.Run this command to list the profiles:    esxcli software sources profile list -d <absolute path of the .zip file>    eg.   esxcli software sources profile list -d /vmfs/volumes/datastore_name/folder_name/file.zip   Output:Name               Vendor    Acceptance Level-------------------------------- ------------ ----------------ESXi-6.0.0-20171101001s-standard VMware, Inc. PartnerSupportedESXi-6.0.0-20171101001s-no-tools VMware, Inc. PartnerSupportedESXi-6.0.0-20171104001-no-tools VMware, Inc. PartnerSupportedESXi-6.0.0-20171104001-standard VMware, Inc. PartnerSupported    6.

Kindly requesting your help with the assignation of 2 monitors screens for Jennifer since it is a request coming from the client and necessary for her onboarding and productivity. As per conversation it seems we might need an adapter to plug in the screens however if we could assign her a compatible device as soon as possible it would be great.

She is located in CUB 77, 3rd floor.

I have created a service account via OKTA that will be used for Direct Message Injection (DMI) for KnowBe4 phish simulations per KB4’s documentation.  This requires Microsoft authentication via the KnowBe4 portal which is typically done by selecting ‘use another account’ where I add the service account information.

 

 

Once I have added the UPN, it appears that OKTA cached credentials take over to validate my authentication and then the permission page prompts for permission elevation via my account, not the service account.

 

 

Is there a way to ensure that Microsoft authentication redirect happens to validate accounts via OKTA rather than cached credentials being passed? 

 

I am more than happy to schedule a call with a team member to fully illustrate this process if this message does not provide sufficient information to address this issue.

 

Thank you for your assistance with this request.

I looked at an email I sent to my gmail account back in January 2023, and in the header it shows:

Hi Rose,

 

Thanks for working on this😊

 

I think common personal email domains are the issue. I don’t know that it is limited to gmail. It could also be yahoo.com. I am trying to think of others that are common. Gmail is probably the most widely used.

Hi Ricardo,

 

Thank you for working on those!

 

Can you please update all of the matrix's on the rest of the sites for all brands, there was other issues Vanessa fixed there.

 

Additionally, the sentences about the plaque need to be removed from both the Join page and Home page for all brands. Examples in screenshots.

 

Thank you,
Natalie

Hi all,

 

@Ricardo Parraga Could you help me change the wording on the Join landing page for the clubs listed below. You’ll need to change this in two sections.

 

In the MEMBER BENEFITS SECTION for 6 bottle and also 3 bottle “Fairwinds Wines & Gifts Offered at a 15% Discount” should be changed to “Fairwinds Wines & Gifts Offered at a 10% Discount”

This is the list of clubs where this change needs to be done.

* 1967 Cellars
* Winning Standard
* Parasol
* Bold Stripes
* Steel Curtain
* Winning Drive

 

 

 

@Lisa Struck  we need to update the image for these clubs and also change to 10% discount on FEW wines. I guess you can provide the updated images to Ricardo when done.

* 1767 Cellars
* Vine 04
* Winning Standard
* Horns & Tail
* Parasol
* Bold Stripes

I have been assigned as your Account Manager from Adobe. I am a part of Adobe’s creative cloud team, and my job is to keep all the subscriptions purchased by organizations like yours optimized.

 

I noticed that your group has several individual creative cloud contracts. Individual memberships are meant for personal usage, and we always recommend having one business account and everyone shall fall under one umbrella so that you get one invoice from Adobe and your account is always streamlined, as we have noticed in the past that organizations end up paying for subscriptions that you no one is using when they have multiple individual subscriptions as nobody cancels their accounts and they keep running.

 

Benefits of having Teams subscriptions over Individual ones are listed below: -

 

·       These assets will become company owned and managed

·       Reclamation of the assets in case of ownership transfers

·       You will receive just one consolidated invoice for all the licenses at your organization

·       The admin will be able to transfer/reassign the licenses without paying any cancelation charges

·       The admin will also be able to keep a track of all the licenses from the centralized admin console

·       All the users on the Team account will have access to 24*7 support for these licenses

 

Rest assured none of the users will be affected and won’t have to changes the credentials as this will be a seamless integration from the backend. We guarantee you a zero downtime.

 

Kindly let me know how to proceed, looking forward to working with you.

 

Please let me know when we can schedule a quick call to discuss the details. Feel free to find a time that works best for you on my  Calendar (https://adobenoidasmb.ormimas.com/c/deewan) .

I think out own network called “FESecure” at the Calistoga Depot is blocking ship hero from some reason.

Andrew reports all computers went down this morning. I have checked with SH and it doesn’t seem to be an issue on their side.

 

If Andrew shares Wi-Fi from his personal cellphone to one of the computers he was able to access ship hero.

 

Could you please take a look?

How to Fix It

The address may be misspelled or may not exist. Try one or more of the following:

·         Send the message again following these steps: In Outlook, open this non-delivery report (NDR) and choose Send Again from the Report ribbon. In Outlook on the web, select this NDR, then select the link ""To send this message again, click here."" Then delete and retype the entire recipient address. If prompted with an Auto-Complete List suggestion don't select it. After typing the complete address, click Send.

·         Contact the recipient (by phone, for example) to check that the address exists and is correct.

·         The recipient may have set up email forwarding to an incorrect address. Ask them to check that any forwarding they've set up is working correctly.

·         Clear the recipient Auto-Complete List in Outlook or Outlook on the web by following the steps in this article: Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365 (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532972) , and then send the message again. Retype the entire recipient address before selecting Send.

If the problem continues, forward this message to your email admin. If you're an email admin, refer to the More Info for Email Admins section below.

-------------------------------


More Info for Email Admins

Status code: 550 5.1.10

This error occurs because the sender sent a message to an email address hosted by Office 365 but the address is incorrect or doesn't exist at the destination domain. The error is reported by the recipient domain's email server, but most often it must be fixed by the person who sent the message. If the steps in the How to Fix It section above don't fix the problem, and you're the email admin for the recipient, try one or more of the following:

The email address exists and is correct - Confirm that the recipient address exists, is correct, and is accepting messages.

Synchronize your directories - If you have a hybrid environment and are using directory synchronization make sure the recipient's email address is synced correctly in both Office 365 and in your on-premises directory.

Errant forwarding rule - Check for forwarding rules that aren't behaving as expected. Forwarding can be set up by an admin via mail flow rules or mailbox forwarding address settings, or by the recipient via the Inbox Rules feature.

Recipient has a valid license - Make sure the recipient has an Office 365 license assigned to them. The recipient's email admin can use the Office 365 admin center to assign a license (Users > Active Users > select the recipient > Assigned License > Edit).

Mail flow settings and MX records are not correct - Misconfigured mail flow or MX record settings can cause this error. Check your Office 365 mail flow settings to make sure your domain and any mail flow connectors are set up correctly. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure the MX records for your domain are configured correctly.

For more information and additional tips to fix this issue, see Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365 (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532972) .

Subject: Action required: Migrate to the Authentication methods policy in Azure Active Directory

The ability to manage authentication methods in MFA and SSPR policies ends 30 September 2024.
[Microsoft Azure]
Migrate to the Authentication methods policy in Azure Active Directory by 30 September 2024

You're receiving this notice because you have authentication methods configured in the legacy Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) MFA and SSPR policies.

On 30 September 2024, the ability to manage authentication methods in the legacy multifactor authentication (MFA) and self-service password reset (SSPR) policies will be retired. Before that date, you'll need to migrate to the Authentication methods policy in Azure AD, which provides all the same capabilities, plus it enables you to:

  *   Centrally manage MFA, SSPR, and passwordless authentication methods.
  *   More granularly target authentication methods to groups of users instead of all users.
  *   Access more secure authentication methods that will be part of future updates of this policy.

Required action

To avoid any disruptions in service, migrate<https://aka.ms/authmethodsmigrationdoc> your authentication methods from the MFA and SSPR policies to the Authentication methods policy before 30 September 2024.

Help and support

If you have questions, get answers from community experts at Microsoft Q&A<http://aka.ms/AzureADQA>. If you have a support plan and you need technical help, create a support request<https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest>:

Kindly requesting your help to check if it is possible to assign a user to the desktop PC located in the CUB 44 on NetSapiens area. PC is plugged to the TV and needed to share real time information on the screen, however if TL logs in with his own user the PC gets locked.

Let us know if a troubleshooting is available or additional information is needed.

Greetings of the Day !

I did validate the account and apparently the support region for this account is marked as EST at the moment which means you are entitled to receive support during EST business hours.
If you wish to change the support region, I recommend you call our toll-free number and talk to customer support team to have it changed accordingly and the case can get re-assigned to the IST hours.
Apologies, we at technical support may not be able to since the customer support team would request to furnish some account details and hence customers need to call the support line directly to make this happen.
We understand it's painstaking and we are looking at improving the process but for the moment, we would suggest you reach out to our CSR team.
Also you can raise the severity of the Ticket during the same time and inform that you have maintenance period booked during the same .

Subject: Website Migration Process

 

Hello Cesar,

 

Stephanie instructed me last night about a new client website migration process in which I need to be able to edit and save host files on my computer (specifically in this location: C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc). To do this, the system requests administrator permissions.

 

Typically, this process is performed early in the day or late at night (depending on the website and the client’s needs) when the IT team is no longer at the office, so there really isn’t anyone that I can ask for assistance with this.

 

Here’s more information about the specific steps for this process:

Greetings of the Day !
Hope you are doing well and thank you for raising the ticket.
My name is Suryansh Gupta and I am from the Technical Support Team at VMware. I will be here to help you resolve your query. As per the SR description,you need assistance in upgarding your ESXI .

Kindly let me know the below information so that we can understand the issue .
1. The current version and build of the ESXI host that you are trying to patch .
2. The Current version of the vCenter that you are using for managing the hosts .
3. Any sort of recent changes done in your environment .
Kindly follow the below steps for upgrading the same.
For the ESXI Host
1 . Check whether the server that you are using is compatible or not.
2. Download the version that you want to upgrade to from the Customer Connect Poral  .
3. Take the Backup if the host using this KB .
4. Place the host into the maintenance  mode  .
5 . Follow the Steps for upgrading the same from here  .
6.For upgrading the same using CLI , follow the below steps
1. Run this command and make sure that the bootbank should not point to tmp folder:
ls -ltrh

2. Upload the .zip file to the datastore.

3.Put the host in maintenance mode and take backup of the host configuration using :

vim-cmd hostsvc/firmware/sync_config
vim-cmd hostsvc/firmware/backup_config

Note: The command should output a URL in which a web browser may be used to download the file. For example :
Bundle can be downloaded at : http://*/downloads/123456/configBundle-xx.xx.xx.xx.tgz
Where * denotes the host IP/FQDN.
The backup file is also located in the /scratch/downloads directory as configBundle-HostFQDN.tgz

4.Browse to that datastore location using the following command:

cd /vmfs/volumes/datastore_name/folder_name/file.zip

5.Run this command to list the profiles:

esxcli software sources profile list -d <absolute path of the .zip file>

eg.
esxcli software sources profile list -d /vmfs/volumes/datastore_name/folder_name/file.zip
Output:
Name                              Vendor        Acceptance Level
--------------------------------  ------------  ----------------
ESXi-6.0.0-20171101001s-standard  VMware, Inc.  PartnerSupported
ESXi-6.0.0-20171101001s-no-tools  VMware, Inc.  PartnerSupported
ESXi-6.0.0-20171104001-no-tools   VMware, Inc.  PartnerSupported
ESXi-6.0.0-20171104001-standard   VMware, Inc.  PartnerSupported

6. Choose profile from point 5 that says -standard and run this command against it:

esxcli software profile update   -d <absolute path of the .zip file> -p <output from 5>
For eg:
esxcli software profile update   -d  /vmfs/volumes/abcderskfjfggjgjgg5h33n444/ESXi600-201711001.zip  -p ESXi-6.0.0-20171104001-         standard

7. It will say that the upgrade completed successfully.

8. Run this command to reboot the host:
reboot

9. If you have encountered dependency errors or conflicting vibs error at point 7, then you may run the below commands to check       whether the vibs are in use or not:

esxcfg-scsidevs -a
esxcfg-nics -l

10. If the vibs are not in use then we can try :

esxcli software profile install -d /vmfs/volumes/583f4e1c-a5c53f88-56ef-           0025b57cac15/VMware_ESXi_6.5.0_10719125_Custom_Cisco_6.5.2.3_Bundle.zip -p VMware-ESXi-6.5.0-10719125-Custom-Cisco-6.5.2.3 --ok-       to-remove

For the vCenter
1.Take the powered OFF snapshot of the vCenter VM .
2.Also take backup of the same if you have any 3rd party software related to backups.
3. Follow the Steps for upgrading the same from here  .

Feel free to reach out to me in case of any concerns.

Hoping to hear from you soon.
Warm Regards

To stay competitive, no organization can afford to remain static. When
making changes that involve the workplace and its people; however, managers
are often faced with a challenging task - successfully implementing new
processes while overcoming resistance to change.


That said, I'd love to provide a guest article for your website outlining
best practices when managing organizational change. Would an article on
that topic be of interest to your readers?

My name is Steve.


I just spent some time on your website Dimension4.com. (Yes, I do random site analyses for a living)


After spending some time there, what I've observed are several things you could immediately do that would help boost your Google rankings, social media, organic traffic along with your conversion rates. 


Not sure what your intentions are in this aspect of your website, but is this something that’s on your radar?

To fix this please sign in again.""  We press the Sign In button and it flashes a window and then reverts to the app screen.  Within a minute the warning icon is displayed next to his account in the top bar.

He has been prevented from saving documents although he can open the applications.  The documents are saved to his local OneDrive folder and they do appear to be synchronizing to the cloud.

What can we do to fix this?

Thank you,
Terry",['support'],email,,370381668214,normal,incident

I want to request a replacement for two mouses as they are not working properly for two of our members.

Marcelo’s laptop has a bad keyboard and needs assessment; Ctl and Alt keys do not work correctly, and they are needed for data manipulation work.

Fernando Obando requires a mouse replacement.

Henry Canas machine is also having faulty keys (windows key does not work and many of the keyboard combinations don’t seem to be working well).

 

We will be available for you to come and make an assessment.

 

Thanks in advance.

Hosted PBX

A hosted PBX, also known as a cloud-hosted PBX, is a phone system hosted and managed by a third-party provider instead of on-premise equipment. It's an internet-based phone system for businesses. Instead of traditional landline lines, a cloud-hosted PBX allows communication through internet channels. This will enable companies to access advanced features, such as call transfer and voicemail to email, without purchasing and maintaining the hardware themselves.  

Call Center Solutions  

Call Center Solutions helps in providing a single platform for all customer interactions regardless of channel. It helps in engaging with customers as they move between channels and devices. It will help in creating a consistent, branded experience across all channels. It also gives agents the information they need to provide excellent customer service. This will lead to higher efficiency and productivity for the employees working in your organisation.

Sip Trunking

Sip trunking uses VoIP technology to transmit phone calls over an internet connection instead of traditional phone lines. It also streamlines business operations and improves overall communication. The sip trunking feature allows you to limit your network traffic so that it only flows through a specific few devices. SIP trunking is simple to set up and configure for regular business domestic calling, provided you have a working internet connection.

Unified Communications

Unified communications integrate various communication methods, including instant messaging, video conferencing, voicemail, email, and desktop sharing. Unified communications can save your organisation time and money by consolidating multiple communication tools into a single interface. This makes it easier for users to communicate and eliminates the need for multiple licences and support contracts.

Espero te encuentres bien

 

Como proceso de actualización y con el fin de mejorar  las relaciones con nuestros clientes OSI trabajara con una empresa hermana de mercadeo con base en Estados Unidos, la empresa se llama GreenStar Solutions.

 

Como parte de la mejora, sus colaboradores nos solicitan acceso a la página web para que el contenido de mercadeo sea coherente con el de nuestra pagina web, ya que como sabrás , nuestro sitio web es una de las maneras en las cuales nuestros clientes pueden comunicarse con nosotros, por lo tanto solicito tu ayuda con dicho requerimiento y te pido mi brindes indicaciones de como debo de proceder con al solicitud.

 

Ya que tu eres el encargado de eso , pensaba en compartirles tu contacto de esa forma en el momento que necesiten acceso tu puedes encargarte de ello.

 

Quedo atento a tus comentarios

Could you help me out adding an icon and text to this page in the URL: https://myosihub.com/attendance-bonus-guideline/ (I’m indicating where it should be on the screenshot below)

 

I’m adding a circle where we want to see it. It should say: “Full work from home or abuse of the benefit will disqualify you from the bonus.”

Subject: Important: We’ll enable security improvements for your organization by May 8, 2023

! CAUTION - EXTERNAL MESSAGE !
Everyone in your organization will need to register for multifactor authentication.
[Microsoft]
The security defaults setting for your Bluewater tenant will be turned on by May 8, 2023

You’re receiving this email because you’re a global administrator for Bluewater.

To help protect your organization, we’re always working to improve the security of Microsoft cloud services. As part of this, we’re enabling the security defaults setting in your tenant that includes multifactor authentication, which can block more than 99.9 percent of identity attacks that attempt to compromise your accounts.

When you log in to your account between April 24, 2023, and May 8, 2023, you’ll see a message prompting you to proactively enable security defaults<https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults#enabling-security-defaults>. If you haven’t logged in or enabled this setting when that timeframe ends, we’ll enable it for you automatically.

Recommended action

After the setting has been turned on, everyone in your organization will need to register for multifactor authentication. To avoid any confusion, please let your users know what to expect:

  *   When they sign into their account, they’ll see a prompt to install the Microsoft Authenticator app—they can choose to install it and follow the steps to register their account or defer the action. After 14 days, the option to defer will disappear.
  *   They’ll need to follow the How to set up the Microsoft Authenticator app<https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/how-to-use-the-microsoft-authenticator-app-9783c865-0308-42fb-a519-8cf666fe0acc> steps to download the app on their mobile device, and then register their account with the app.

Read complete information about the security defaults<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults> setting. If you have questions or if you need help, contact support<https://support.microsoft.com/topic/contact-microsoft-office-support-fd6bb40e-75b7-6f43-d6f9-c13d10850e77>.

Do we have any policy in place that prevents a guest user to access our Teams Channel from India?

 

If so, will need to allow access to the tenant from India.

Ashok,

 

Good speaking with you today – our USDA information is directly available, need to look into the HHS documents but will do so before COB.

 

We also have another candidate engagement with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) which we are finishing up now (so no CPARs) but a detailed SOW, and I can get an email assessing our performance from the client, and risk/issues log that we control on our Teams/SharePoint. 

 

Brgs,

 

Ted

hrivas  Office 365      cecastillo
Action Required                 Recipient
Unknown To address

How to Fix It
The address may be misspelled or may not exist. Try one or more of the following:

  *   Send the message again following these steps: In Outlook, open this non-delivery report (NDR) and choose Send Again from the Report ribbon. In Outlook on the web, select this NDR, then select the link ""To send this message again, click here."" Then delete and retype the entire recipient address. If prompted with an Auto-Complete List suggestion don't select it. After typing the complete address, click Send.
  *   Contact the recipient (by phone, for example) to check that the address exists and is correct.
  *   The recipient may have set up email forwarding to an incorrect address. Ask them to check that any forwarding they've set up is working correctly.
  *   Clear the recipient Auto-Complete List in Outlook or Outlook on the web by following the steps in this article: Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365<https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532972>, and then send the message again. Retype the entire recipient address before selecting Send.

If the problem continues, forward this message to your email admin. If you're an email admin, refer to the More Info for Email Admins section below.

Was this helpful? Send feedback to Microsoft<https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=525921>.
________________________________

More Info for Email Admins
Status code: 550 5.1.10

This error occurs because the sender sent a message to an email address hosted by Office 365 but the address is incorrect or doesn't exist at the destination domain. The error is reported by the recipient domain's email server, but most often it must be fixed by the person who sent the message. If the steps in the How to Fix It section above don't fix the problem, and you're the email admin for the recipient, try one or more of the following:

The email address exists and is correct - Confirm that the recipient address exists, is correct, and is accepting messages.

Synchronize your directories - If you have a hybrid environment and are using directory synchronization make sure the recipient's email address is synced correctly in both Office 365 and in your on-premises directory.

Errant forwarding rule - Check for forwarding rules that aren't behaving as expected. Forwarding can be set up by an admin via mail flow rules or mailbox forwarding address settings, or by the recipient via the Inbox Rules feature.

Recipient has a valid license - Make sure the recipient has an Office 365 license assigned to them. The recipient's email admin can use the Office 365 admin center to assign a license (Users > Active Users > select the recipient > Assigned License > Edit).

Mail flow settings and MX records are not correct - Misconfigured mail flow or MX record settings can cause this error. Check your Office 365 mail flow settings to make sure your domain and any mail flow connectors are set up correctly. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure the MX records for your domain are configured correctly.

For more information and additional tips to fix this issue, see Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365<https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532972>.

I have a question regarding a shared mailbox. We are researching an issue and need to find emails contained in a shared mailbox (acamoscio@gemini-ind.com). The shared mailbox’s Inbox contains messages dating back to 04/22/2022, after which it displays the message “Currently displaying all messages newer than 12 months.”

 

I don’t know if there is a setting that controls the maximum age of messages displayed in a shared mailbox, and if so, where it can be found. Is there a way to display older than 12 months?

 

Thank you,

Vince

CAUTION: External Sender

 

Hi Fernando,

 

Chris and Edgar have had some problems with TimelyBill access again today.

 

I ran it by Engineering, and Mark had some suggestions to try and isolate the issue.

I’ve shared these comments with Edgar and Chris.

 

Engineering suggestions:

Does it happen at the same time to anybody else?  there is a ipsec vpn connecting the OSI office network to our Seattle network, and then another ipsec vpn connecting Threshold over to TimelyBill

and our proxy server tbproxy sits in the middle.. so we need to figure out if the disruption is between the PC at OSI and our tbproxy server;  or if its’ between tbproxy over to TimelyBill

 

If you can reach tbproxy but then tbproxy has trouble reaching the TimelyBill end, is when you get that nginx gateway timeout 502 error page.  The proxy spits that out, which makes it clear the user’s web browser was able to reach the proxy. The proxy IP is 172.16.12.58. So you could ask OSI when it seems to be timing out to quickly open a command prompt and see if they get a ping reply from 172.16.12.58.

 

If they do not it would point more toward the ipsec vpn between OSI and Threshold having trouble. And if that is the case other things that work across the vpn would also presumably not work, so another good question is ask if loading the Freeside ticketing page where we do maintenance is also broken at the same time. FreeSide url https://freeside.corp.threshinc.com/freeside/index.html

 

It could also somehow be DNS lookup temporarily fails to work.. but if that was the case browser would say something like “host not found”.

Checking with Chris and Edgar we’re not seeing a browser error while it’s down.

 

Thanks,

   New Feature Highlights: VMware Aria Operations for Logs Endpoint Discovery Skyline recently added support for Operations for Logs, and now Skyline will automatically detect your Operations for Logs endpoints and prompt you to connect them to your Skyline Collector. This enables you to easily add your endpoints and benefit from Skyline proactive Findings and Recommendations to avoid issues. https://u12668197.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=6iGNSpqHRcwtiIAH-2FSt-2FcMykewjlTXWh5-2BIHJ1nrhNUQ7AcYbDt5dOPRR6QyVK-2FxTRBVwfBuNNQZB4-2FEN0OFSP8AuHP-2BlLlW6yIbxtG5Qx8-3D4L1p_-2BHB8d5C343hfLp7ljYtulT4AqbeLZ38PYBdqNT1vgjI0Zi3B3Anxpq0bQnMfJhjd8EGrHw7-2Bx3WfXKonnz0xMtM-2F4LqQKNCN0CgYnI20aS1r6BdjvZn7SnU-2FAn8gujguoWxTkUoNNoRoyVp7dX9y9jRSk64ZGLZP8lUsPHvwXGavpduTsgrRw-2FnDhJlpwnscjdcyV8GvNcVtHTMRSvUPzB-2F9mlbDpmtRs9OB0zC984em5VuxUmkY3xBSP-2B8fPFuA2ZCetDNahWYLOGWDFVbeDWUJhGrUBxhu68GG3koUfP9BGkwlC9i0DgEb27tqz0Im7lOLyWeOPygRDVsGTQajfB6eSLSWinzEUeS5SAn07ezqr-2BwzDKWkoNxB83vg-2F9F7   Product Name Updates VMware rebranded all vRealize products to ""Aria"" in late 2022.

   Skyline Collector Tip: Note that if your Collectors are running v3.1, you must manually upgrade them, due to an issue in how the proxy configuration is propagated from the Skyline UI through the backend service to the OS level. This has been resolved in subsequent Collector versions, and the Auto-Upgrade function works as intended.

This morning Ted.langhoff@kymadvisors.com has received an impersonation user attempt just like Vijay a month ago. It is really weird how an attacker is able to send email as the user. Upon my initial investigation, I had figured out that it has originated from JP.

 

I would like to block all incoming emails from all countries except US, Canada, and India. That way we would be blocking all such impersonation user attempts. Almost all the attempts for the last few months have been originating from Japan IP addresses.

 

I look forward to hearing from you.  

 

 

Thanks,

I need to upgrade an existing OS on one of our computers used for CAD. The current OS is Windows 10 Home.

 

This PC will be used by our CAD designer at home, so I can either join it to the domain or leave it off.

 

Please let me know if we can upgrade to windows 11 pro, or do we need a new install?

Hi ladies,



See below changes requested.



Thank you,

Subject: RE: One Heart Event packages



CAUTION: External Sender



Hi Edith,



Here are my suggestions. I've italicized the proposed edits.

  *   Opening paragraph: ""Elevate your alumnae events with access to premium event packages from Sigma Kappa's One Heart Club. Enjoy a selection of fine wines and special benefits for a memorable gathering with sisters.""



Why Purchase Event Packages? (For consistency, I'd suggest using the same font for ""Why"" that you used for ""Included"" and ""Packages"" in the last two sections.)



  *   ""Support Sigma Kappa and help make a meaningful difference..."" (omit ""us"")



  *   Some of the content is in first person (""we"") and some is in second (""you, your"")) - i.e., ""Bring your alumnae community..."" ""...celebrates our sisterhood and the timeless traditions we hold dear."" I'd suggest switching all language to second person, since this was created by Fairwinds, and you talk about the assistance and support Fairwinds offers.



  *   ""If you are an alumnae chapter president or a member organizing an alumnae event....""



  *   ""...please fill out the form at the bottom of the page or use the contact information below to reach out to Edith Rios, (include your title here).""



What's Included?

·         ""...exclusively for the One Heart Club and Sigma Kappa alumnae.""

·         ""A uniquely Sigma Kappa fire-branded, vintage wooden wine crate.""



Event Packages

·         Do members have the ability to customize packages?

·         Does special pricing exist for other options (smaller price points or for a larger-sized party or celebration)?

·         If so, I would stipulate that there is the ability to customize packages and to contact Edith for details. This lets our members know that these aren't the only options.



*Morgan and Mallory, if you have thoughts related to the layout, images and/or content edits, please respond to this thread by Thursday, April 14. I've added Jordan in case she has additional suggestions or any concerns.



Related to a testimonial, is it possible to reach out to one or two alumnae who have been top purchasers for the One Heart Club and offer them a small token for being such a dedicated customer? You could then ask if they would be willing to highlight their experience and One Heart wines in a testimonial for the site.



Best,

Diane

Hello,

Your certificate (or certificates) for the names listed below will expire in 19 days (on 2023-04-27). Please make sure to renew your certificate before then, or visitors to your web site will encounter errors.

We recommend renewing certificates automatically when they have a third of their total lifetime left. For Let's Encrypt's current 90-day certificates, that means renewing 30 days before expiration. See https://letsencrypt.org/docs/integration-guide/ for details.

For details about when we send these emails, please visit: https://letsencrypt.org/docs/expiration-emails/ In particular, note that this reminder email is still sent if you've obtained a slightly different certificate by adding or removing names. If you've replaced this certificate with a newer one that covers more or fewer names than the list above, you may be able to ignore this message.

For any questions or support, please visit: https://community.letsencrypt.org/ Unfortunately, we can't provide support by email.

</br>
I am a professional hacker and have successfully managed to hack your operating system.</br>
Currently I have gained full access to your account. </br>
</br>
In addition, I was secretly monitoring all your activities and watching you for several months. </br>
The thing is your computer was infected with harmful spyware due to the fact that you had visited a website with porn content previously. &#9581; &#5198; &#9582;</br>
</br>
Let me explain to you what that entails. Thanks to Trojan viruses, I can gain complete access to your computer or any other device that you own.</br>
It means that I can see absolutely everything in your screen and switch on the camera as well as microphone at any point of time without your permission. </br>
In addition, I can also access and see your confidential information as well as your emails and chat messages.</br>
</br>
You may be wondering why your antivirus cannot detect my malicious software. </br>
Let me break it down for you: I am using harmful software that is driver-based, </br>
which refreshes its signatures on 4-hourly basis, hence your antivirus is unable to detect it presence.</br>
</br>
I have made a video compilation, which shows on the left side the scenes of you happily masturbating, </br>
while on the right side it demonstrates the video you were watching at that moment..&#7508;.&#7508;</br>
</br>
All I need is just to share this video to all email addresses and messenger contacts of people you are in communication with on your device or PC. </br>
Furthermore, I can also make public all your emails and chat history.</br>
</br>
I believe you would definitely want to avoid this from happening. </br>
Here is what you need to do - transfer the Bitcoin equivalent of 1490 USD to my Bitcoin account </br>
(that is rather a simple process, which you can check out online in case if you don't know how to do that).</br>
</br>
Below is my bitcoin account information (Bitcoin wallet): 1DxrzqzwqDBw1jcHUZv1Qb9eFFfYzdiXCY</br>
</br>
Once the required amount is transferred to my account, I will proceed with deleting all those videos and disappear from your life once and for all. </br>
Kindly ensure you complete the abovementioned transfer within 50 hours (2 days +). </br>
I will receive a notification right after you open this email, hence the countdown will start.</br>
</br>
Trust me, I am very careful, calculative and never make mistakes.</br>
If I discover that you shared this message with others, I will straight away proceed with making your private videos public.</br>
</br>
Good luck!",['support'],email,,370417943294,low,incident

Chad, FYI, below is a message pop up about my account settings are out o date. Would. I was not able to follow the instructions and did not want to click on any “FIX IT” buttons.

 

Do you suppose this has something to do with my current Outlook problem?--Dan

 

Your account settings are out-of-date in Mail or Calendar for Windows 10

Calendar for Windows 10 Mail for Windows 10

If you receive a message in Mail or Calendar for Windows 10 that your account settings are out of date, there are several things you can do to fix the problem.

Check your password

The most common cause of an out-of-date account is an incorrect password. Select Fix account in the notification bar at the top of the Mail or Calendar app. If your password is incorrect, you'll see a message asking you to update your password. Enter the new password and choose Done.

Tip: If you want to change the password for your account with your email provider—for example, Gmail or iCloud—you'll need to visit the website for your email provider. See Change your password (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/change-your-password-in-mail-for-windows-10-7941bfd6-7b96-49c3-a2ca-0631dfb298eb)  for more information.

Check your security certificate

If your password isn't the problem, you may have a certificate error. If so, you'll see a message that says, ""There is a problem with the server's security certificate. The security certificate is not from a trusted certifying authority.""

This error often happens when you don't use SSL to secure your email account. To fix this error, use the following steps.

1.    Choose Settings > Manage Accounts.

2.    Choose the account that's out of date to display the account settings dialog.

3.    Choose Change mailbox sync settings > Advanced mailbox settings. You may have to scroll down in the dialog to see Advanced mailbox settings.

4.    Check the boxes for Require SSL for incoming email and Require SSL for outgoing email and then choose Done > Save.

<p class=""MsoNormal"" dir=""auto""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" dir=""auto"">How are you? I received the <i>Azure AD Identity Protection Weekly Digest</i> email this morning (email dated 4/4/2023 03:06). I don’t know what period the report actually covers, but it indicates 1 new risky user detected and 15 new risk
 sign-ins detected. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" dir=""auto""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" dir=""auto"">The <b>Identity Protection | Risky users</b> listed a risky user dated 3/31 and another dated 3/28, both at the Low risk state. There were another 7 at the Remediated risk state between 3/27 and 4/2. I’m not sure how that equates to 1 new
 risky user detected.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" dir=""auto""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" dir=""auto"">The <b>Identity Protection | Risky sign-ins</b> page listed 7 risky sign-ins dating back to 3/27 — 2 At risk, 3 Remediated, and 2 Dismissed. There are only 12 total for the last month. I don’t understand how the
<i>Azure AD Identity Protection Weekly Digest</i> got to 15.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" dir=""auto""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" dir=""auto"">Perhaps I don’t understand what Microsoft is counting, what the reporting period is, or something else, but the results in Microsoft Azure do not appear to match the report. Am I misinterpreting the
<i>Azure AD Identity Protection Weekly Digest</i> Information?<o:p></o:p></p>

Vijay.Mehra@kymadvisors.com has been getting a lot of phishing attempts to gain company financial account information. Some of them show that they have been blocked in quarantine but they are been delivered to his inbox. Can we please check why there are being delivered when they have not been released yet from Quarantine?

 

See the screen shot below:

 

 

 

Can we add additoinal filter to contain such attempts so that they do not get delivered to user’s inbox? Also need to check why the current anti-phish filters are not working as they are supposed to.

Hello Vijay,



I was investigating it and the spam filters did work, it’s under quarantine section. From the quarantine area, looks like the below email is already quarantined, can you double check and let me know if it was in your inbox or junk/spam email.  It should have gone to your junk/spam folder.



Probably you got a notification on your mobile device, as mobile device alerts(notifications) all new incoming email both inbox and spam/junk similarly.













Thanks,

Sai

New Release: VMware Aria Operations for Logs Integration and Log Assist Enhancements

 The latest release of Skyline includes VMware Aria Operations for Logs product integration and Log Assist enhancements. Ensure your Skyline Collectors are current to take advantage of the new features.

   Aria Operations for Logs Product Integration

 Skyline now provides proactive intelligence for Aria Operations for Logs, adding another VMware product Skyline analyzes to keep productive and healthy in your environment. Once you add your Aria Operations for Logs endpoints to your Skyline Collector(s), you can begin viewing proactive Findings and Recommendations to stay out of harm's way.

 Skyline Administrators now have the option to activate or deactivate the Log Assist automated support log bundle upload feature from the Advanced Settings tab in Skyline Advisor Pro. This gives Skyline Administrators greater control and more flexibility in adhering to organizational policies.

 We strongly recommend running the latest Skyline Collector version v3.3 to take advantage of all Skyline features. All of your Collectors must be on v3.0 or above to access Skyline Advisor Pro, which is smarter, easier and 12X faster than Skyline Advisor. Customers running Collector v2.1 and below who have not upgraded will no longer see data provided by those Collectors in Skyline Advisor. As a reminder, VMware supports n-2 versions of the Skyline Collector. Currently versions 3.0 and below are no longer actively supported under General Support. https://u12668197.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=6iGNSpqHRcwtiIAH-2FSt-2FcA6KtlntXNvi6Munun60w7c4uEIa-2FIPtYGViN3mq-2F4RZh25GpwVqHsKGwQ7iyXlaO5MwExAmDqjMMTPhe-2BzViRfMaVFdpK8PRX7OWcRIGaEapZofwXYlWv58WjQ843Ki38MzwWYrWMqi9daOrEtMVW0-3Dl3rY_-2BHB8d5C343hfLp7ljYtulT4AqbeLZ38PYBdqNT1vgjI0Zi3B3Anxpq0bQnMfJhjd8EGrHw7-2Bx3WfXKonnz0xMtM-2F4LqQKNCN0CgYnI20aS1r6BdjvZn7SnU-2FAn8gujguoWxTkUoNNoRoyVp7dX9y9jRSk64ZGLZP8lUsPHvwXGZR25gWVaqiLStLYeTHUC-2BkLLORHj2FDrO54jzgYc7lwspv4tltirhimuENJyibmy8r38ZrF3oAwT3mpkpShrPD80-2FcostaXloWHIQ7miBl-2BEupf-2B1IJgraj4Yt4R4pr-2FZ15T1-2Fm6PbsWZ-2FCNIfPKL8-2FzdgPK7frcBt8MH9k-2F8WD-2BXyM-2BpNUih5wU-2FG0spFg-2BoOBlitdi-2FTB67qvLOv64Aa .

 Note that if your Collectors are running v3.1, you must manually upgrade them, due to an issue in how the proxy configuration is propagated from the Skyline UI through the backend service to the OS level. This has been resolved in subsequent Collector versions, and the Auto-Upgrade function works as intended. Please refer to https://u12668197.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=6iGNSpqHRcwtiIAH-2FSt-2FcKySMdwaBnEuRuzONUr7IsrHMmrQcvQbhpnTRxWGQ5ckfDfS_-2BHB8d5C343hfLp7ljYtulT4AqbeLZ38PYBdqNT1vgjI0Zi3B3Anxpq0bQnMfJhjd8EGrHw7-2Bx3WfXKonnz0xMtM-2F4LqQKNCN0CgYnI20aS1r6BdjvZn7SnU-2FAn8gujguoWxTkUoNNoRoyVp7dX9y9jRSk64ZGLZP8lUsPHvwXGZR25gWVaqiLStLYeTHUC-2BkLLORHj2FDrO54jzgYc7lwspv4tltirhimuENJyibmy-2FIwAOs2vp27aT9uVYNqeU9YxjXiepcoyVRp9IPuVw3u5kRHJVSg6mtzVzlwiklhaLIVQEY7pG8JFZmK0XT4iYbCma-2FinQmO-2FTUxYVPHVKje70OQlugbt8ZFhUfKU2wvljXGHYaH2L5fHtynnK4BR2j .

   Tips and Tricks: Bulk Product Operations

 Tired of adding, updating, or deleting endpoints from your Skyline Collector one by one?

 Check out Skyline's Bulk Product Operations feature. It's a great way to reduce ""manual touch time"" because it automates the creation, modification, and deletion of multiple endpoints from your Skyline Collector with a single CSV file.

 
To access Bulk Product Operations, log in to your Skyline Collector webpage and go to the Configuration Tab. 
Download and complete the provided CSV template, including the login credentials of the supported products that you want to add, delete, or update. 
Drag and drop CSV file into the interface. When the process is complete, you'll get a summary of all the tasks that were performed, which is also visible under the System Status Tab of your Collector page.   To see this workflow in action, check out this https://u12668197.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=6iGNSpqHRcwtiIAH-2FSt-2FcJRTt8jTClsjbuTrfrxF5C80mPBks-2F532qYpN1J-2BtEYjhq1S_-2BHB8d5C343hfLp7ljYtulT4AqbeLZ38PYBdqNT1vgjI0Zi3B3Anxpq0bQnMfJhjd8EGrHw7-2Bx3WfXKonnz0xMtM-2F4LqQKNCN0CgYnI20aS1r6BdjvZn7SnU-2FAn8gujguoWxTkUoNNoRoyVp7dX9y9jRSk64ZGLZP8lUsPHvwXGZR25gWVaqiLStLYeTHUC-2BkLLORHj2FDrO54jzgYc7lwspv4tltirhimuENJyibmy-2Bj3BH14Fy26TuarXjz-2FvUbLPAcQ1TF5r9B555nDahC38RBe-2BZCf7tkFCUGJYp1uoPIJXguywGCio-2F2uibbgClRx-2FiaCPE3bCda5Ov-2BMxeNV-2Bkk1tBD0ch2OWe1cIPREzGlk-2B4dibxbcgCB-2BlKjSpqS

We are going to hold off on the labor right now and just upgrade a single license to do our own testing. Please let me know when the new license is available.

We can do the upgrade right away, and Edwin offered you to do some tests to see if we can do it without the license. However, as Microsoft advised, we can't do that. Any labor will be billed against the project hours if we make the upgrade.

Hi Dan - yes, you can upgrade a single license to make the configurations. Keep in mind any user that will have access to the devices will need their own account (license)

Hello Dan/Tyler,

 

We have confirmed with Microsoft, and it will be necessary to upgrade from MS 365 Business Standard to MS 365 Business Premium.

 

Please let us know your thoughts on the quote I sent you so we can start planning accordingly.

Patrick Dwyer has reported missing mail in his sent folder for Outlook. Can you investigate the issue. Please see his details on the missing email below. Thanks, Rose

 

 

 

 

I am looking for the sent thread I originally sent to Arnold Yoon, March 30, 2023 at 11:29AM. See below. I have highlighted it in GREEN.:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Patrick,

Looks like a healthy opportunity. I think that question #1 in the RFI is your opportunity to talk about User Experience and its value to the project.

The conversation starts much earlier than identifying metrics and measuring them. Ultimately doing some research with actual users will provide some of the highest value information. Here are some questions that you can use in your answer:

* What are their needs?

* How do the needs of multiple user types differ?

* What are HRC's primary needs, and how do these needs intersect?

* Is there a current solution that's in place now?

* How well does it work (or not work)?

* What specific pain points do the users have?

Regarding the metrics question, two of the most common metrics are CSAT and NPS. Additionally, more granular and specific methods can be used to target specific processes and the effectiveness of the implementation. For example:

* Time to task completion

* Accuracy of completion

* Ability to resolve a specific issue

Ultimately, both user research and metrics should be used throughout the lifecycle of any implementation. Before any coding, architecture, or design work happens, baselines should be determined along with understanding key problems and business needs. Ideally, during the design/prototyping process, testing should be run again, to validate (or invalidate) the quality of the proposed solution - such that changes can be made before expensive and time consuming implementation happens.

And certainly, metrics and testing should happen after a solution goes live - the ""real world"" usage matters, and metrics can validate the success of the implementation, along with understanding/quantifying how improvements/iterations can be made.

I hope this helps,

Duane,

 

Every week at the Marketing meeting Jay gets about 12 emails from me saying I have accepted the meeting.  This is a recurring meeting I accepted long ago and did not even open the invite.  No updates were made but he continues to get them.  It has happened to some of my other meetings as well.  Have you seen this and how can we make it stop?


Thanks!

We are having an issue were users lose network connectivity to network resources (printers, network drive, software, etc.) while connected to the wired network in the Jeffersonville Office.

 

This typically occurs at least once a day and is typically in the afternoon.

 

Rebooting the computer will be a temporary fix, but the issue occurs again. 

 

Connecting to the wireless network does not replicate the same issue. 

 

I’ve attached a txt file for ipconfig ran from an affected computer

Thank you for contacting Microsoft Support - a support case has been opened for you.

For your reference:

* Case #: 35530428

* Created on: Wednesday, March 15, 2023 1:37 PM

* Description: Our customer reported that since Thursday, 09, all outlook profile pictures have disappeared. She said that the only way someone can see the profile picture is by clicking the profile, but it's different from how it was before. They are using the Outlook app, and they have checked the website, and the pictures are showing there, so there is a problem with the app. Our customer said that this happened after an update on their environment.

Remember, Microsoft will never ask for your password as part of any support interaction. Also, please don´t send any financial or personal information in email.

Hello Chris,

 

HR and I will meet with Ligia at 5:00 pm ET. During that meeting, we will process the termination.

 

Once the process is over, I will email you to confirm the termination was completed. I would advise you to cancel her credentials at 5:15 pm ET, just in case of some delay.

Good Morning Cesar,

 

I wanted to inform you that Patty is out sick today, so I will be the main POC for Elizabeth’s departure. I wanted to check in and see if you can let me know what the timeline and the gameplan for this so we can be adequate prepared and aligned to eliminate her access.

I've read Microsoft articles and found a policy that shows we do NOT have audio-conference option, but I can't see how to add.  Do I have to purchase that ability??

We let him use his Thompson email to communicate within the company and with outside suppliers. Our administration would like to restrict his ability to receive emails from customers.

 

We added a restriction to his mailbox that only allows certain users the ability to send him mail. The problem is that he works with certain suppliers that use different email accounts, and sometimes generic accounts. Do we have a way to authorize an entire domain instead of specifying individual users?  

 

Do I need to create a mail flow rule in addition to the added restriction on his individual mailbox?

Good afternoon all,

 

 

I’m reaching out to get some assistance with Cecilia’s computer.   She has been having issues and it reboots on it’s own daily or more.      With her work load,  having her computer down has been very disruptive for her and our team.    Can we get a new updated replacement for her as soon as possible ?   In the meantime,   can you assist her with the issues she is having ?

Security or policy violation

 

How to Fix It

The recipient's email server won't accept your message because it appears to violate their security or policy settings. Check the Reported error below to see if you can determine why it was blocked. Then try one or more of the following:

·         If the error mentions SPF, DKIM, or DMARC issues, forward this message to your email admin for assistance.

·         The recipient's email server might suspect that your message is spam. Follow the guidance in this article: E-mailing Best Practices for Senders (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=526654) . Then resend your message.

·         If the error suggests your message is too large, try to reduce the size of your attachment. If that isn't possible, place the file on a publicly accessible cloud storage location, like OneDrive. Then add a link to the file in your message, and resend the message.

·         Contact the recipient (by phone, for example) and tell them to ask their email admin to add you or your email domain to their allowed senders list.

If the problem continues, forward this message to your email admin. If you're an email admin, refer to the More Info for Email Admins section below.

More Info for Email Admins

Status code: 550 5.7.1

This error occurs when the recipient's domain has security or policy settings that reject the sender's message. However, we were unable to determine the specific setting that's causing this rejection. Usually the error is reported by an email server outside of Office 365. Common issues include the following: the receiving server suspects the message is malicious or spam; the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record for employbridge.com is incorrectly configured or doesn't exist; or the message includes an attachment larger than the receiving server will accept. Try one or more of the following:

Review the reported error - Check the Reported error shown below to help determine what the issue might be. For example, if the issue is related to an SPF failure, the reported error will usually include the acronym ""SPF"" or the phrase ""Sender Policy Framework.""

Correctly configure your SPF records - If you're the sender's email admin, make sure your domain's SPF records at your domain registrar are properly configured. Office 365 supports only one SPF record (a TXT record that defines SPF) for your domain. Include the following domain name: spf.protection.outlook.com. If you have a hybrid configuration (some mailboxes in the cloud and some mailboxes on premises) or if you're an Exchange Online Protection standalone customer, add the outbound IP address of your on-premises servers to the TXT record. To learn how, see Customize an SPF record to validate outbound email sent from your domain (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn789058(v=exchg.150).aspx) and External Domain Name System records for Office 365 (https://support.office.com/article/External-Domain-Name-System-records-for-Office-365-c0531a6f-9e25-4f2d-ad0e-a70bfef09ac0#BKMK_SPFrecords) .

Unable to relay - If the Reported error indicates a problem with relaying (e.g. ""unable to relay""), then the email server that reported the error likely isn't set up correctly to receive and relay messages from the sender's domain. This server will usually be one of your on-premises servers in a hybrid environment, a smart host email service that you're trying to route messages through, or possibly even an email hosting service you used in the past yet still have mail flow settings pointing to (e.g. your MX record at your domain registrar still points to your previous email service provider). Check Error reported by shown below to determine what domain, service, or server is reporting the error. The email server needs to be configured to either accept messages from anonymous users or to include the sending domain or IP in its list of authenticated senders. On an Exchange server, you can set this up in the server's receive connector. If it's a smart host managed by another service or partner, contact the service or partner to configure their servers to accept and relay messages from your senders. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure your MX records are properly configured.

Contact the recipient's email admin - For some scenarios, you can fix the issue by contacting the email admin at the recipient domain to ask them to add the sender's email address or your domain to their allowed senders list, or to relax the setting that's causing the rejection.

For more information and tips for fixing this issue, see Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.7.1 in Office 365 (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=389365) .

Can you please help me to understand, the attachment that you added to the previous ticket is a PDF scan of a physical email delivered to your physical address?, because if that is the case, our scope of support is limited your email address security not your physicals address, however in my experience that looks like a scam, but you should further investigate and clarify if its a scam or not, if this was sent via email, please provide all the details we need such as the sender email address so we can black list his domain, i hope you understand our limitations.

Thanks

Hi Nestor,

 

I am not seeing the licence addition.

 

I require an MS365 E5 licence, not the E5 Security.

 

Thanks

Hi Sofia, will I be able to pick who has access if we choose to use it? We only need it for 2-5 people.

 

Would it be easier to just sign up for it and use a credit card?

[cid:d86b63b7-e1d3-41d8-a14e-66c9f9c9dabb]
Allie used to be part of our Studio division that no longer exist, we had changed her SMTP address to @bluewatertech.com from @bluewater.studio when she was moved to a new position in the company. We have done this with other users and never run into a problem. This is the 3rd time we have had to engage D4 for this exact same issue. We have 90 day password policy so our users have to update their password every ¼. As soon as Allie changed her password today her account stopped working.

You can contact Allie directly for troubleshooting at 616-299-3837

I have copied Terry Cole on this email as I will be out of the office until Monday the 27th. Please make sure Terry is included in all correspondence on this issue.

Protect your organization, Gemini Industries Inc., with Azure AD security defaults

There are over 300 million fraudulent attempts to sign in to our cloud services every day. All it takes is one compromised credential or one legacy application to cause a data breach. One of the best things you can do to prevent these attacks is to turn on multifactor authentication (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks) , which can block over 99.9 percent of account compromise attacks.

Enable security defaults (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults) to adopt security best practices, such as requiring multifactor authentication and disabling insecure protocols. Security defaults will ensure that your security settings stay up-to-date until you decide to manage them yourself. There is no additional cost.

Starting the week of March 22, 2023, we’ll make it easier for you to enable security defaults by presenting you with a message when you sign in to your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account through your web browser.If you don’t take action per the message, security defaults will be enabled after 14 days. If you’d like to get started, you can enable security defaults (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults#enabling-security-defaults) today.

 

When you enable security defaults:

·     You as a Global Administrator will be asked to register for multifactor authentication using the Microsoft Authenticator app (https://www.microsoft.com/security/mobile-authenticator-app?rtc=1) and your phone number.

·     Everyone else in your organization will be asked to register with the Microsoft Authenticator app for multifactor authentication.

If you have other questions, read our documentation (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults) . If you need more support, create a support request in the Azure portal (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request) .

Hola Irene,

 

Gracias por la paciencia. Le envió el enlace con la cotización, reduje una licencia de cada una de las subscripciones y las puse en el precio mensual para que pueda ver la diferencia entre ambas.

Hello Jack – we will disconnect your account at the end of the month. I was waiting for our billing team to confirm we received your payment for March 2023 invoice before getting back to you. Unfortunately, we haven't received it yet, but it should be here soon.

 

Also, no refund can be made as the service was provided.

 

We will send you a confirmation email once the disconnection it's complete. Unfortunately, due to Microsoft terms, we can only remove the licenses after the end of the month.

 

Thank you for being a valuable partner while we assist you as your CSP.

CAUTION: External Sender

 

Please confirm that this email sent a week ago has been received and cancelation is occurring.

 

Note – I had requested the disconnect to occur immediately.  I was notified of a clause indicating I needed to give a 60-day notice which I promptly did at that time. 

 

If Dimension 4 is going to require the full 60-day notice to cancel Office 365 service – I would like to be credited for all of the monthly charges that Fabtex was billed for the Azure server which I requested to be decommissioned in October 2022 and that I was still being invoiced for in February 2023.  I would calculate that I should receive a credit in the amount of $2,905.78.

 

November 2022 = $ 774.92

December 2022 = $ 755.13

January 2023 = $779.48

February 2023 =    $ 596.25

 

Total = $ 2,905.78

I wish to cancel all Office 365 services from Dimension for the Fabtex account as soon as possible.  I have been told this may take up to 60 days.  I would prefer that it occur quicker than that and that we could drop the licensing at the end of March (which has already been paid for) – I would especially ask for this to be considered in light of the fact that I had requested an Azure server be disconnected in October and was still paying for it in February.  If Dimension 4 will not cancel the account earlier, please consider this email as our 60 day notice which would be through 5/14/2023.

 

If you have any questions, please contact me at the numbers below or via email.

Hi Pam.

The issue is on the Blakley Products receiving email server’s side. When you send email out of P21, the server receiving your email expects the you to have an alltileccs.com email address not blakelyproducts.com. Your receiving server knows it is the only server that should be sending mail from you, so the email is marked as a spoof, email pretending to be from you. Your company’s security settings are preventing you receiving this email. Unfortunately, I was expecting this to be an issue.

 

This message was generated by the sending server.

Contact the administrator of your Microsoft 365 tenant. They might get around this problem by creating an Inbound Connector. I am not sure this will bypass the spam policy, so they may also whitelist 40.142.36.140 (https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/WN_VC2kG7kckYzouOmj_T?domain=nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com) .

Your message to pam.dundas@blakelyproducts.com couldn't be delivered.

When Office 365 tried to send your message, the receiving email server outside Office 365 reported an error.

Policy violation or system error

 

How to Fix It

Check the ""Reported Error"" from the ""Error Details"" section shown below for more information about the problem. The error might tell you what went wrong and how to fix it. For example, if the error states that the message was blocked due to a potential virus or because the message was too large, try sending the message again without attachments.

If you're not able to fix the problem, it's likely that only the recipient's email admin can fix it. Contact the recipient by some other means (by phone, for example) and ask them to tell their email admin about the problem. Give them the ""Reported Error"" from the ""Error Details"" section below.

More Info for Email Admins

Status code: 550 5.0.350

The error reported by the receiving server wasn't specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. These errors often indicate the message violates a security or policy setting configured on the recipient's email servers.

If the sender is unable to fix the problem by modifying their message, then it's likely a problem that only the recipient's email admin can fix. Try the following:

Check the error for information about the problem - The ""Reported Error"" returned by the external email server can be found in the ""Error Details"" section below. This error might tell you what went wrong and provide clues for how to fix it. For example, if the error states the message was rejected due a Sender Policy Framework (SPF) issue, then you'll have to work with your domain registrar to correctly configure your domain's SPF records.

Check the error for information about where the problem is happening - For example, look for a domain name like contoso.com. A domain name in the error might suggest who is responsible for the error. It could be the recipient's email server, or it could be a third-party service that your organization or the recipient's organization is using to process or filter email messages.

If you can't fix the problem, contact the responsible party's email admin - Give them the error code and error message from this non-delivery report (NDR) to help them troubleshoot the issue. For security or policy violation issues, it might be sufficient for them to just add your sending IP addresses or domain to their allowed senders list.

It's likely that only the recipient's email admin can fix the problem. Unfortunately, it's unlikely Office 365 Support will be able to help with these kinds of externally reported errors.

Hi Eric,

 

I am having issues with downloading photos in bulk from SharePoint. You can download photos one at a time without issue, but if you download a set of photos as a zipped file, they are corrupted. See the files attached. Other members of the team have reported the same issue today. Please advise if this can be fixed.

I have been assigned as your Account Manager from Adobe. I am a part of Adobe’s creative cloud team, and my job is to keep all the subscriptions purchased by organizations like yours optimized.

 

I noticed that your group has several individual creative cloud contracts. Individual memberships are meant for personal usage, and we always recommend having one business account and everyone shall fall under one umbrella so that you get one invoice from Adobe and your account is always streamlined, as we have noticed in the past that organizations end up paying for subscriptions that you no one is using when they have multiple individual subscriptions as nobody cancels their accounts and they keep running.

 

Benefits of having Teams subscriptions over Individual ones are listed below: -

 

·       These assets will become company owned and managed

·       Reclamation of the assets in case of ownership transfers

·       You will receive just one consolidated invoice for all the licenses at your organization

·       The admin will be able to transfer/reassign the licenses without paying any cancelation charges

·       The admin will also be able to keep a track of all the licenses from the centralized admin console

·       All the users on the Team account will have access to 24*7 support for these licenses

 

Rest assured none of the users will be affected and won’t have to changes the credentials as this will be a seamless integration from the backend. We guarantee you a zero downtime.

 

Kindly let me know how to proceed, looking forward to working with you.

 

Please let me know when we can schedule a quick call to discuss the details. Feel free to find a time that works best for you on my  Calendar (https://adobenoidasmb.ormimas.com/c/deewan) .

After a Windows update Barracuda VPN stopped working. I tried to open the application to activate the VPN but it is just running in the background based on the Task Manager, but the application does not open. I've restarted the computer and did not bring any solution.

Crexendo IT recommended to uninstall Barracuda and re-install it, I need your help with admin approval to do this.

I will be out of the office from Friday, March 17th to Wednesday, March 29th, due to my absence all emails coming to my inbox in my outlook account must be forwarded to Alexa’s mail, since she will be following up with some of my clients, starting March 30th, everything should be back to normal.

 

Alexa’s email: amerino@osinearshore.com

 

Thanks for the support.

 

Regards.

Security or policy violation

 

How to Fix It

The recipient's email server won't accept your message because it appears to violate their security or policy settings. Check the Reported error below to see if you can determine why it was blocked. Then try one or more of the following:

·         If the error mentions SPF, DKIM, or DMARC issues, forward this message to your email admin for assistance.

·         The recipient's email server might suspect that your message is spam. Follow the guidance in this article: E-mailing Best Practices for Senders (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=526654) . Then resend your message.

·         If the error suggests your message is too large, try to reduce the size of your attachment. If that isn't possible, place the file on a publicly accessible cloud storage location, like OneDrive. Then add a link to the file in your message, and resend the message.

·         Contact the recipient (by phone, for example) and tell them to ask their email admin to add you or your email domain to their allowed senders list.

If the problem continues, forward this message to your email admin. If you're an email admin, refer to the More Info for Email Admins section below.

More Info for Email Admins

Status code: 550 5.7.1

This error occurs when the recipient's domain has security or policy settings that reject the sender's message. However, we were unable to determine the specific setting that's causing this rejection. Usually the error is reported by an email server outside of Office 365. Common issues include the following: the receiving server suspects the message is malicious or spam; the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record for mota-design.com is incorrectly configured or doesn't exist; or the message includes an attachment larger than the receiving server will accept. Try one or more of the following:

Review the reported error - Check the Reported error shown below to help determine what the issue might be. For example, if the issue is related to an SPF failure, the reported error will usually include the acronym ""SPF"" or the phrase ""Sender Policy Framework.""

Correctly configure your SPF records - If you're the sender's email admin, make sure your domain's SPF records at your domain registrar are properly configured. Office 365 supports only one SPF record (a TXT record that defines SPF) for your domain. Include the following domain name: spf.protection.outlook.com. If you have a hybrid configuration (some mailboxes in the cloud and some mailboxes on premises) or if you're an Exchange Online Protection standalone customer, add the outbound IP address of your on-premises servers to the TXT record. To learn how, see Customize an SPF record to validate outbound email sent from your domain (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn789058(v=exchg.150).aspx) and External Domain Name System records for Office 365 (https://support.office.com/article/External-Domain-Name-System-records-for-Office-365-c0531a6f-9e25-4f2d-ad0e-a70bfef09ac0#BKMK_SPFrecords) .

Unable to relay - If the Reported error indicates a problem with relaying (e.g. ""unable to relay""), then the email server that reported the error likely isn't set up correctly to receive and relay messages from the sender's domain. This server will usually be one of your on-premises servers in a hybrid environment, a smart host email service that you're trying to route messages through, or possibly even an email hosting service you used in the past yet still have mail flow settings pointing to (e.g. your MX record at your domain registrar still points to your previous email service provider). Check Error reported by shown below to determine what domain, service, or server is reporting the error. The email server needs to be configured to either accept messages from anonymous users or to include the sending domain or IP in its list of authenticated senders. On an Exchange server, you can set this up in the server's receive connector. If it's a smart host managed by another service or partner, contact the service or partner to configure their servers to accept and relay messages from your senders. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure your MX records are properly configured.

Contact the recipient's email admin - For some scenarios, you can fix the issue by contacting the email admin at the recipient domain to ask them to add the sender's email address or your domain to their allowed senders list, or to relax the setting that's causing the rejection.

For more information and tips for fixing this issue, see Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.7.1 in Office 365 (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=389365) .

No es en sí para crear el usuario, por implementación ellos se refieren a que el usuario esté como el cliente lo desea, entrenamientos, pruebas y todo lo que involucre el proceso.

Buenas tardes Wilfredo,

 

El día Viernes me comentaron de Softland que el usuario que usted necesita es uno que no está incluido en la licencia que actualmente se ha adquirido, este tipo de usuario que usted solicita sería un costo extra y una implementación extra, la cual me dijeron que es alrededor de 20-30 horas adicionales a las que tenemos pactadas para la implementación de RRHH.

 

En ese caso sería de consultar con el vendedor el costo que tendría este usuario y si Anthony lo aprueba.

 

Saludos,

Daisy

Esto con el objetivo de poder extraer los datos para los reportes de AZ.

 

Saludos.

Thank you for getting back to me, I appreciate it!

Correct, as I log in and am prompted to select an option for 2FA, my only options are to either call or send a text message to my phone number. My military e-mail is not appearing as an option, even though you also see that I configured it as such on my account.

Subject: Questions about our 2FA

 

Good Afternoon Mr. Maconi, 

 

My name is Daniel Tipton, I am a contractor with Gemini supporting ACT. I was advised that you may be the correct person to contact regarding an issue myself and others are having with our outlook Gemini accounts.

As of recent, I have been relocated to work at the Pentagon supporting a new task, and because I am working at a SCIF, I am not allowed to bring in any personal electronics, let alone a non-compliant GFE. With that said, and as I believe is the same for everyone, our Gemini outlook accounts log out every week as per sound security reasons, and require that we all sign in again every 7 days.

As part of the security measures, I have set up 2FA with my personal phone number, I plan to do it with my office line inside the SCIF once I am assigned one, and I recently assigned 2FA to my military e-mail. Even with this set up, whenever I access a new computer inside the SCIF, my only options for 2FA are to send a code via text or phone call. By the time I click send, exit the SCIF, retrieve my phone, and enter into the SCIF, the code (in some occasions) already times out for not being fast enough. My other colleagues reportedly have this same issue and have foregone logging in, reporting to our Project Manager that it is too difficult. I know outlook offers whatever option one chooses for 2FA, including to e-mails, but for some reason with the Gemini outlook accounts the same could not be said, which seems rather odd.

I wanted to know if this could be addressed and configured to allow our military e-mail addresses to work as an alternative 2FA option to improve our ability to access our Gemini accounts as needed.

I appreciate any support you can provide both myself and my colleagues. 

 

Kind regards,

How to Fix It

An email admin at kymadvisors.com has created a custom mail flow rule that blocks messages that meet certain conditions, and it appears that your message has met one or more of those conditions.

·         Check the text above for a custom message from the email admin that may help explain why your message was blocked and how you might be able to fix it. For example, removing prohibited words from the message or sending the message from a different email account may be sufficient to deliver your message.

If you've tried and you're still not able to fix the problem, consider contacting the email admin at kymadvisors.com to discuss what to do. While they're unlikely to remove or relax the rule, if you have a legitimate need to deliver your message they may offer guidance for how to do so.

More Info for Email Admins

Status code: 550 5.7.1_ETR

This error occurs because an email admin at kymadvisors.com has created a custom mail flow rule that has blocked the sender's message.

In some cases, the sender can change the message so it no longer violates the rule. However, depending on the rule's conditions, it's possible that the only way to deliver the message is to change the rule itself, and only an email admin at kymadvisors.com can do that. Although it's possible the rule is unintentionally flawed or it's stricter than the admin intended, it may be working exactly as they want it to.

Incluyo a @Edwin Pineda para que pueda brindarle una respuesta. Adicional, tenemos la siguiente consulta para ustedes.

 

Podría confirmar cuales usuarios deben tener las licencias asignadas. En este momento veo que les sobran 3 del SKU Microsoft 365 Business Basic, pero también tienen un sobreuso de las Microsoft 365 Business Standard las cuales solo pueden asignar 28 y en este momento hay 33.

 

 

Los cambios de termino y cantidades ya fueron modificadas como nos indicaron:

Hola,

 

Buen día. Si también necesitamos que borren del todo dichas cuentas ya que estas personas ya no laboran en la empresa. Estamos haciendo un backup de la información del OneDrive y aprovechando quería consultarle: ¿Existe alguna herramienta para hacer el backup completo de la información de estos usuarios en Office365? Por ejemplo: SharePoint, Correo electrónico, OneDrive, Teams.

 

Saludos cordiales,

Hola Irene,

 

Gracias por la paciencia. Le envió el enlace con la cotización, reduje una licencia de cada una de las subscripciones y las puse en el precio mensual para que pueda ver la diferencia entre ambas.

 

Quedo a la espera de la confirmación de cuantas licencias quedarían en termino anual y mensual.

 

Cualquier consulta estoy a la orden.
