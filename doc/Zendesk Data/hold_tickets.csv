I need to troubleshoot who rebooted a VM in our infrastructure last night around 22 hours ago from now. This is the Fortigate Virtual Machine.

 

For some reason, it rebooted – it thinks it was because of a power disruption, but that shouldn’t be possible due to Azure… Right?

Nothing happens though:

 

I feel like this is an issue that I should understand because we’re working on trying to deploy Teams globally now and replace ShareFile with MS Teams… We can’t do that if we can’t add external people to a team or channel so they can access what they need to access though…

 

I’ve verified the permissions – not sure what else I could be doing wrong here, just seems like there’s some bugs in the system still…

29615,411375451273,411375451273,2023-04-18T21:45:31Z,Email Problem,"Good afternoon,

 

Me again! I have another issue to report. Earlier today (12:38 EDT), I received an email from another Gemini employee, Maria Bradley. The problem is that I was not included among the addresses of the email. Here’s the header:

 

 

 

I double-checked the outgoing message and confirmed that I was not in the list of addresses (there was no Bcc). I then checked Message Trace and found the message:

 

 

I opened the message in Message Trace:

 

 

 

I then clicked on “Prepare and email extended report”:

 

 

I submitted the request at 16:47 EDT. After 40 minutes, I received the message below:

If I am interpreting this message correctly, Microsoft did not find the message that Message Trace had already found and from which I submitted the request for the extended report. That seems to suggest that the message that was not addressed to me, which I did in fact receive, and which I did find using Message Trace, does not actually exist.

 

Can you help me understand what is happening here? I am very concerned that email messages are being delivered to persons to whom they were not addressed. That would be a MAJOR problem.

CAUTION: External Sender

Hector,

 

We are required by our client to use Google Chrome because of Netsapiens software however Google Chrome program is memory intensive and leave us little room to have other tools open at the same time that are also required to do our job.

 

I would like to request another 4GB (8GB ideally) added for all computers however I was advised by OSI IT they don’t have available extra memory since new PC’s use DDR4.
