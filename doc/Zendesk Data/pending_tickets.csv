Hi Ricardo,

Can you please assist us on the Great Day website, we'd like to know if you can please reduce the amount of white space between the title and content? In comparison to other websites and other sections on this website there is a much larger amount of white space here.

The OKTA session has routinely updated licensing that has been configured in the Office portal.  We are preparing to test Intune device management and with that need to have various license types as options from within OKTA to associate with the accounts.


  1.  How can we isolate an account in a manner that is no longer governed by OKTA?  I am unable to create a service account against lcsfin.com (only option we have is <account name>@lcsfin.onmicrosoft.com which will not work for what we need it to do.  I need an account created (onboarding@lcsfin.com) that has necessary licensing and appropriate permissions for Intune management and joining devices to AAD, but I am unable to complete this via O365 Admin portal or Azure AD.
  2.  If I create an account in OKTA, I am unable to associate Microsoft Business Premium, Microsoft E3, or Microsoft E5 licensing due to the limitations defined within the profile configuration.  These licenses will be available later this week.

Please advise on how best to adjust accounts appropriately to accommodate a very aggressive initiative timeline.

Thank you for your assistance with this request.

Fran's Old Version local Outlook is not synchronizing with her OWA but the New Version local Outlook is.  The problem is neither the New Version local Outlook nor the OWA accurately reflect her current Old Version local Outlook where she always works.

Last week she toggled the ""try new Outlook"" button in the upper right of her Old Version local Outlook and it downloaded and opened the ""new"" version in a separate Window.  She has both of these local apps running on her local machine now and noticed the New Version and OWA are not accurately reflecting what she has done in her Old Version.

She is responding to and moving messages to subfolders in her Old Version local Outlook and has her Inbox trimmed to just 22 messages.

When she views her mailbox online in OWA or in the New Version local Outlook the Inbox contains 436 messages, all the ones that she has read, answered, and moved to subfolders in her Old Version local Outlook are still there.

The app on her phone is also showing the OWA count, not the Old Version local app Inbox.

I have scanned the settings for both the OWA and local apps and I don't see anything unusual.

The problem started about a week ago.

I have attached screenshots for your review.

Thank you,
Terry

29551,411375451273,411375451273,2023-04-12T20:01:03Z,Outlook Problem,"Good afternoon,

 

One of my users and I (so far) are having a problem with Outlook. Specifically, attempting to attach a file to an email crashes Outlook with Exception code: 0xc0000005. I have copied the details from Event Viewer below this message. Both of us installed the latest Windows update this morning, and the latest Office update, so I suspect that’s where the problem lies. The affected users and version details are as follows.

 

Me (vmaconi@gemini-ind.com)

Device name: HYB-VWDB4KWFXNQ

Windows 11 64-bit Release 22H2 Build 22621.1555

Office version 16.0.16130.20394

 

Brenda Smyth (bsmyth@gemini-ind.cvom)

Device name: HYB-BB2AMSLWTXG

Windows 10 64-bit Release 21H2 Build 19044.2846

Office version 16.0.16130.20394

 

Can you please check if there is a known problem with the latest Windows and/or Office releases that would cause Outlook to fail when attempting to attach a file? If so, please provide your recommendations to resolve the issue.

 

I will try to determine if anyone else is having the same problem.

 

Thanks,

Vince

Hello Edwin.

I have another issue -

 

[6:21 AM] Duane W. Mizell

 

 

 

[6:21 AM] Duane W. Mizell

I am trying to follow directions to create an access review to automatically remove accounts older than 180 days and I'm getting messages that I need an Azure AD P2 license....

 

[6:29 AM] Duane W. Mizell

I realize that we don't have 500+ concurrent licenses with Microsoft Office365, and I realize that we're not ""the largest firm"", but we're spending $50k a year, minimum, on Microsoft services - just through Dimension4. Surely we can work out some kind of an agreement that gives us some better ""deal"" than having to ""fight for"" or ""request access to"" (referencing the Cost Analysis portion here, Azure AD P2 licenses, InTune, MS Defender for Workstations, SCCM licensing... Others...) 

 

There's SO many services that Microsoft offers and I fell like we are kind of just getting the ""bare minimum"" to get by when we could probably ""pay a little more"" and get access to many, many, more services (like the aforementioned). 

 

[6:30 AM] Duane W. Mizell

Microsoft doesn't have anything to lose by giving us a deal on this stuff - we're forced to use Microsoft, so I'm not sure why we can't identify a mutually beneficial relationship that helps everyone here out. 

 

[7:45 AM] Duane W. Mizell

Edwin, on top of the above conversation, I'd also like to know how I can check how close we have come to our transaction limit(s) for our storage accounts over the past 6 months. I know there are limits based on the size of the storage account for how many transactions we can perform and I'm curious about, specifically, the cool-tiers and what their limits are and how close we've came.",['support'],email,,1900028126905,normal,incident

·    Storage in Dataverse for the tenant includes all types of environments except trial, preview, support, and developer.

·    The most common cause of decreased capacity is an app using an increased amount of storage.

I appreciate your patience, we had opened a ticket with Microsoft to allow us to adjust the window time to cancel the licenses, and they confirmed we could do that by March 31st.

 

At the moment, there are no additional steps on your end. However, our support team will contact you and coordinate when the licenses are turned off.

 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Hey Sofia!

 

As in the email below, please move forward with converting our yearly licenses to monthly licenses, as we are preparing to switch providers at the end of our contract.

 

I have included a representative from our new provider on this email chain for better communication.

 

Can you please list the remaining steps we need to complete to fulfil the cancellation of our contract?

Below is a screenshot of the Term and Renewal section of your TOS. It looks like all we have to do is email your legalnotice@dimension4.com within 60 days prior to the date of our renewal.

 

Please confirm that information and let me know our renewal date and the first date that falls within the 60 days prior. I have April 2nd marked in my calendar but please confirm.

 

Thank you Sofia!

Hey Sofia!

 

Our yearly licenses come up for renewal around Feb 2023. Can you mark that we would like to switch these all to monthly when it becomes available?

 

What does that process look like?

 

Thank you!
