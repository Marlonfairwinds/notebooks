Born on September 22, 1852 in Abingdon, Virginia, &ldquo;Lon&rdquo; Jackson as he was known was described &ldquo;Gentle as a woman, firm as a rock &ndash; a perfect bundle of nervous energy. His love of the Fraternity knew no bounds, and his enthusiasm was so contagious that it influenced everybody who came within his reach.&rdquo; At the Baltimore convention of 1876 he was elected Worthy Grand Master, the first to hold that office. He married Mary Ernest later that year and would go on to father two future Kappa Sigma Brothers: J. Ernest Jackson (Mu Chapter) and Minter Jackson (Lambda Chapter). Stephen Alonzo Jackson died before his 40th birthday on March 4, 1892. At the 1894 Richmond Grand Conclave, March 4th was officially pronounced and is still celebrated within Kappa Sigma as Stephen Alonzo Jackson Day.<br /><br />We introduce you to S.A. Jackson.

Kappa Sigma Fraternity&rsquo;s heritage began here in 1400 in &ldquo;The City of Letters&rdquo; as a society of students banded together for mutual protection. As is known today, this society spread to the other great universities throughout Europe and eventually North America.<br /><br />Our Pinot Noir from Santa Barbara County experiences a lengthy and cool growing season that is similar to the climate of the Burgundy region of east-central France. Unlike Burgundy, our Pinot Noir experiences dense fog that rolls in off the Pacific Ocean; this fog contributes to the ideal climate for Pinot Noir, offering just enough moisture to be beneficial without lingering too long.<br /><br />1088 has aromas of cherries, raspberries, blackberries, and brown sugar with notes of baking spices. On the palate, the wine opens with bright, fruit flavors of strawberries, leading to a round mouthfeel on the mid-palate and soft, velvety tannins on a long, elegant finish.</p>\\n<p><strong>Retail Price:</strong> $58.00</p>\\n<p><strong>1869 Club Member Price: </strong>$45.00</p>\",\n",

Every member that has attended can retell stories of the camaraderie and fellowship of these events where good food and drink is had by all.<br /><br />This premium sparkling wine &ndash; meticulously and artfully made in the traditional champagne method &ndash; rivals anything found from the best Champagne houses in &Eacute;pernay and Reims. Blended superbly from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this magnificent Napa Valley Brut exhibits rich fruit aromatics of strawberry and delicate white cherry that follows through to a creamy mid-palate accompanied with highlights of lime and wet minerality and a lingering vibrant finish.</p>\\n<p><strong>46 East Lawn:</strong></p>\\n<p>Named after Brother McCormick&rsquo;s room, 46 East Lawn was the central meeting place at the University of Virginia for the Five Friends and Brothers when they founded Kappa Sigma Fraternity on December 10, 1869.<br /><br />From the chalky soil of the Carneros region in southern Napa Valley, this gem exhibits lush green apple and bright grapefruit notes while dancing across your palate. This stunning wine is light and friendly with very subtle vanilla and pear blossom hints on the nose. Balanced fruit with tarte acidity makes this wine a classic example of Premium Napa Chardonnay.</p>\\n<p><strong>Crescent:</strong></p>\\n<p>Stephen Alonzo Jackson was a merchant by trade and traveled extensively throughout the United States. In the early days of Kappa Sigma, each trip would also further the expansion of the Fraternity. Between 1873 and 1892, Brother Jackson established 45 new Kappa Sigma Fraternity Chapters beginning with the Mu Chapter at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia to the Alpha-Kappa Chapter at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. This explosion of new chapters occurred along the third longest train route in the United States known as the Crescent, which Brother Jackson used frequently. Established in 1847 by the Richmond and Danville Railroad, the Crescent eventually connected New York City to New Orleans, Louisiana and provided a vital trade route for the eastern United States.<br /><br />We introduce you to our flagship Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, Crescent. This is a premium and classic representation of the appellation&rsquo;s preeminent varietal. Notes of black cherry, blackberry and plum are complemented by hints of toasted oak, dried currant and baking spice. Fine-grained tannins and ample brightness on the palate give way to a polished mouthfeel and exceptionally long finish.</p>\\n<p><strong>Retail Price:</strong> $599.00</p>\\n<p><strong>1869 Club Member Price: </strong>$479.20</p>\",\n",

Every member that has attended can retell stories of the camaraderie and fellowship of these events where good food and drink is had by all.<br /><br />This premium sparkling wine &ndash; meticulously and artfully made in the traditional champagne method &ndash; rivals anything found from the best Champagne houses in &Eacute;pernay and Reims. Blended superbly from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this magnificent Napa Valley Brut exhibits rich fruit aromatics of strawberry and delicate white cherry that follows through to a creamy mid-palate accompanied with highlights of lime and wet minerality and a lingering vibrant finish.</p>\\n<p><strong>46 East Lawn:</strong></p>\\n<p>Named after Brother McCormick&rsquo;s room, 46 East Lawn was the central meeting place at the University of Virginia for the Five Friends and Brothers when they founded Kappa Sigma Fraternity on December 10, 1869.<br /><br />From the chalky soil of the Carneros region in southern Napa Valley, this gem exhibits lush green apple and bright grapefruit notes while dancing across your palate.

In the early days of Kappa Sigma, each trip would also further the expansion of the Fraternity. Between 1873 and 1892, Brother Jackson established 45 new Kappa Sigma Fraternity Chapters beginning with the Mu Chapter at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia to the Alpha-Kappa Chapter at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. This explosion of new chapters occurred along the third longest train route in the United States known as the Crescent, which Brother Jackson used frequently. Established in 1847 by the Richmond and Danville Railroad, the Crescent eventually connected New York City to New Orleans, Louisiana and provided a vital trade route for the eastern United States.<br /><br />We introduce you to our flagship Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, Crescent. This is a premium and classic representation of the appellation&rsquo;s preeminent varietal. Notes of black cherry, blackberry and plum are complemented by hints of toasted oak, dried currant and baking spice. Fine-grained tannins and ample brightness on the palate give way to a polished mouthfeel and exceptionally long finish.</p>\\n<p><strong>Retail Price:</strong> $999.00</p>\\n<p><strong>1869 Club Member Price: </strong>$799.20</p>\",\n",

The &ldquo;halo&rdquo; Jackson described was a beautifully expanded and symbolic Ritual which he introduced in 1880 at the Grand Conclave in Abingdon, Virginia. Drawing on his knowledge of Masonic ritual forms and ceremonies, he incorporated the history shared through the experiences of Brother Arnold and the European teachings of Brother Hollingsworth to build a unique ceremony that binds all members of Kappa Sigma Fraternity. One that requires a belief in certain values including that man is responsible to a higher authority.<br /><br />We introduce you to our elegant Halo Cuv&eacute;e Blanc. This is an alluring and complex white wine blend, with a sensuous offering of tropical fruits, white flowers and subtle spice. The nose is like a bouquet of flowers and jumps from the glass with ripe lemon, white peach and orange blossom followed by notes of toast and white pepper. On the tongue, lemon bursts forward with pineapple and other tropical fruit, with undertones of vanilla. The finish is bright and zingy and mellows with vanilla and subtle spices in its length.</p>\\n<p><strong>Retail Price:</strong> $44.00</p>\\n<p><strong>1869 Club Member Price: </strong>$35.00</p>\",\n",

This is an alluring and complex white wine blend, with a sensuous offering of tropical fruits, white flowers and subtle spice. The nose is like a bouquet of flowers and jumps from the glass with ripe lemon, white peach and orange blossom followed by notes of toast and white pepper. On the tongue, lemon bursts forward with pineapple and other tropical fruit, with undertones of vanilla. The finish is bright and zingy and mellows with vanilla and subtle spices in its length.\",\n",

In the early days of Kappa Sigma, each trip would also further the expansion of the Fraternity. Between 1873 and 1892, Brother Jackson established 45 new Kappa Sigma Fraternity Chapters beginning with the Mu Chapter at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia to the Alpha-Kappa Chapter at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. This explosion of new chapters occurred along the third longest train route in the United States known as the Crescent, which Brother Jackson used frequently. Established in 1847 by the Richmond and Danville Railroad, the Crescent eventually connected New York City to New Orleans, Louisiana and provided a vital trade route for the eastern United States.<br /><br />We introduce you to our flagship Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, Crescent.

He, along with his lifelong friend and Brother George Wyatt Hollingsworth, are credited by Brother Stephen Alonzo Jackson with discovering and conveying the Bologna Tradition from Europe. Dr. Arnold, as he was later known, married after his graduation and practiced medicine in New York City for many years. His home continued to be a meeting place of Kappa Sigmas in the early days of the Fraternity. His son, Robert Miles Arnold, cemented his legacy and was an initiate of the Gamma-Zeta Chapter at New York University in 1908.<br /><br />The 2019 Founders Red Wine is an artful red blend created by winemaker Todd Heth. This wine exhibits dark blackberry, bing cherry and plum notes perfectly into layers of coffee and tobacco. The finish is dry with long lasting berry fruit.

Every member that has attended can retell stories of the camaraderie and fellowship of these events where good food and drink is had by all.<br /><br />This premium sparkling wine &ndash; meticulously and artfully made in the traditional champagne method &ndash; rivals anything found from the best Champagne houses in &Eacute;pernay and Reims. Blended superbly from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this magnificent Napa Valley Brut exhibits rich fruit aromatics of strawberry and delicate white cherry that follows through to a creamy mid-palate accompanied with highlights of lime and wet minerality and a lingering vibrant finish.</p>\\n<p><strong>1088:</strong></p>\\n<p>Founded in 1088, the University of Bologna is the oldest university in continuous operation in the world and the first of its kind as a degree-awarding institution. Kappa Sigma Fraternity&rsquo;s heritage began here in 1400 in &ldquo;The City of Letters&rdquo; as a society of students banded together for mutual protection. As is known today, this society spread to the other great universities throughout Europe and eventually North America.<br /><br />Our Pinot Noir from Santa Barbara County experiences a lengthy and cool growing season that is similar to the climate of the Burgundy region of east-central France. Unlike Burgundy, our Pinot Noir experiences dense fog that rolls in off the Pacific Ocean; this fog contributes to the ideal climate for Pinot Noir, offering just enough moisture to be beneficial without lingering too long.<br /><br />1088 has aromas of cherries, raspberries, blackberries, and brown sugar with notes of baking spices. On the palate, the wine opens with bright, fruit flavors of strawberries, leading to a round mouthfeel on the mid-palate and soft, velvety tannins on a long, elegant finish.</p>\\n<p><strong>46 East Lawn:</strong></p>\\n<p>Named after Brother McCormick&rsquo;s room, 46 East Lawn was the central meeting place at the University of Virginia for the Five Friends and Brothers when they founded Kappa Sigma Fraternity on December 10, 1869.<br /><br />From the chalky soil of the Carneros region in southern Napa Valley, this gem exhibits lush green apple and bright grapefruit notes while dancing across your palate. This stunning wine is light and friendly with very subtle vanilla and pear blossom hints on the nose. Balanced fruit with tarte acidity makes this wine a classic example of Premium Napa Chardonnay.</p>\\n<p><strong>Crescent:</strong></p>\\n<p>Stephen Alonzo Jackson was a merchant by trade and traveled extensively throughout the United States. In the early days of Kappa Sigma, each trip would also further the expansion of the Fraternity. Between 1873 and 1892, Brother Jackson established 45 new Kappa Sigma Fraternity Chapters beginning with the Mu Chapter at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia to the Alpha-Kappa Chapter at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. This explosion of new chapters occurred along the third longest train route in the United States known as the Crescent, which Brother Jackson used frequently. Established in 1847 by the Richmond and Danville Railroad, the Crescent eventually connected New York City to New Orleans, Louisiana and provided a vital trade route for the eastern United States.<br /><br />We introduce you to our flagship Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, Crescent. This is a premium and classic representation of the appellation&rsquo;s preeminent varietal. Notes of black cherry, blackberry and plum are complemented by hints of toasted oak, dried currant and baking spice. Fine-grained tannins and ample brightness on the palate give way to a polished mouthfeel and exceptionally long finish.</p>\\n<p><strong>Retail Price:</strong> $1,899.00</p>\\n<p><strong>1869 Club Member Price: </strong>$1,519.20</p>\",\n",
